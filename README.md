# Ruql::Olx

This formatter requires [ruql](https://github.com/saasbook/ruql) and
allows formatting RuQL quizzes as OLX (Open Learning XML, a format
developed and used by [edX](https://edx.org) for rendering course assets).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'ruql-olx'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install ruql-olx

## Usage

The simplest usage is `ruql olx quizfile.rb > output.olx`.
`ruql olx -h` shows options that let you specify a different HTML/CSS
template, among other things.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
